## Burgerama-Burger-Shop Managment and User Interface

## Description
The Burgerama Burger Shop requires a simple Console Application to manage the sale and supply of
their famous Burgers to any costumer in the hood.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Just load the solution into Visual Studio. It is run on .Net 6. Make sure your IDE is configured for C# and .Net

## Usage
You cant just start the console application. A manual user test case exel file can be found in the subfolder materials.

## Project status
So as of now the status of the project with the current Base and Extension Requirements is complete. The Project might be picked up on in the future. As a learning experience i planned to build a Web Api of this Project and later on give it a UI with Angular but this will be handled as a seperate project
